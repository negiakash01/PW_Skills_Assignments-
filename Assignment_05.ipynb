        "***Ans-->*** In compiled languages, the source code is transformed entirely into machine code by a compiler before execution, producing a standalone executable that the CPU can run directly. This approach usually offers faster execution speeds because the program is already translated into low-level instructions optimized for the processor.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, interpreted languages execute the source code directly, line by line, using an interpreter that translates instructions at runtime. While this allows for quicker code testing and easier debugging, it typically results in slower execution since the translation happens on the fly."

        "***Ans-->*** Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows a program to respond to and manage errors (exceptions) that occur during its execution, rather than abruptly crashing. Using special blocks such as try, except, else, and finally, Python programmers can write code that anticipates potential issues, catches specific exceptions when they arise, and defines alternative actions or cleanup code."

This makes it especially useful for cleanup activities such as closing files, releasing resources, or freeing up memory that must happen no matter what occurs during the execution of the try block. Even if an exception is caught in an except block or if no exceptions occur at all, the code inside the finally block will still run."

When a file is opened, it consumes system resources like memory and file descriptors, which are limited. If files are not closed properly after use, these resources remain allocated, potentially leading to resource exhaustion that can cause your program or even the entire system to slow down or crash. Additionally, file operations often use internal buffers to optimize reading and writing processes. Closing the file guarantees that all buffered data is flushed and physically written to disk, preventing data loss or corruption."

One key issue is dealing with circular references, where objects reference each other, preventing the reference count from dropping to zero and thus delaying memory release. Although Python’s garbage collector can detect and clean up these cycles, they still can cause memory leaks if not handled properly. Another challenge is memory fragmentation and inefficient allocation, which can reduce application performance and increase memory usage over time."

The basic syntax is raise ExceptionType(\"error message\"), where ExceptionType can be any built-in or custom exception class.

It is especially beneficial in scenarios where tasks involve waiting for I/O operations, such as reading files, network communication, or interacting with databases, because while one thread is waiting, others can continue processing.
